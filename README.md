# Not-A-Lizard
A silly portfolio-style website.

It was mainly used as a practice for creating some basic javascript web elements as well as some good practice with graphic design. It is not finished but I am pretty happy with the way it looks. It was originally designed with a preset dreamweaver layout because it sets the different monitor sizes/mobile compatability conveniently in css, but from there essentially everything was re-written myself. I also have a pre-made menu bar in for now as I have not got around to making my own. I plan on eventually taking the layout of this website and creating a genuine portfolio.
